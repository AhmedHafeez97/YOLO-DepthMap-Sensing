## YOLO-DepthMap-Sensing

Parking Lot Object Detection and Depth Mapping

This project utilizes the YOLO algorithm to detect objects in frames extracted from a pre-recorded video of a parking lot. The detected objects include:

 1. No Parking Zone
 2. Occupied (Car)
 3. Available Park Area
 4. Person

Additionally, the project incorporates MiDaS to generate depth maps, providing a spatial understanding of the parking lot environment.

Features:
 1. Object Detection
 2. Detect and classify key objects in a parking lot.
 3. Output includes bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
 4. Depth Mapping
 5. Generate depth maps using MiDaS for each frame.
 6. Provides a sense of depth and distance in the parking lot.
